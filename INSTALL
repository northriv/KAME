KAME instllation notes

KAME needs following libraries:
Qt >= 5.7 or Qt 6 with Qt5 compatibility module
boost
ruby
gsl
fftw (ver.3)
ftgl
eigen3
lapack/atlas/blas
(optional) linux-gpib or National Instruments 488.2 library
(optional) National Instruments DAQmx library 

KAME now uses some of C++11 functionalities, so the C++ compiler has to be eighther of:
clang++ >= 2.1.
g++ >= 4.5. 

To build KAME, simply do:
qmake (options) (path_to_source_dir)
make
make install (probably as a super user)

Or, follow the notes for the specific systems (INSTALL.*).
