KAME needs following libraries:
kdelibs (ver. 4) and others depending on kdelibs

ftgl
lapack/atlas/blas
(optional) linux-gpib or National Instruments 488.2 library
(optional) National Instruments DAQmx library

KAME now uses some of C++11 functionalities, so the C++ compiler has to be eighther of:
clang++ >= 2.1.
g++ >= 4.5. 

To build KAME, simply do:

make
make install (probably as a super user)

Or, follow the notes for the specific systems (INSTALL.*).
