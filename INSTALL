KAME instllation

KAME needs following libraries:
kdelibs and others depending on kdelibs
boost
ruby
gsl
fftw (ver.3)
linux-gpib (optional)
National Instruments DAQmx library (optional)
FTGL (included in source tree)
mikachanfont (included in source tree)

ftgl has to be expanded to KAME root source directory.
The document files and the font file of mikachanfont has to be copied to (root-source)/kame/mikachanfont

To build FTGL
in directory FTGL/unix
./configure --enable-static --disable-shared
make # perhaps -fpermissive option is needed in CFLAGS for gcc-4.

To build KAME
./configure (options)
make
make install
