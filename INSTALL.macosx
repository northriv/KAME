KAME instllation notes on Mac OS X.

See INSTALL for general information.

For MacPorts users:
Make your own port tree, see http://guide.macports.org/#development.local-repositories
Put kame's Portfile in (your port tree)/kde/kame/.
And,
	sudo port -v install kame  
Strart dbus:
	launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist
Have fun!,
	open /Applications/MacPorts/KDE4/kame.app


For Fink users:

At the moment (Nov. 2009.), kdelibs4 cannot be built in Snow Leopard.

First, install the required packages (kde4-buildenv, kdelibs4-mac, boost, ftgl, fftw3, gsl) with fink. XCode is of course necessary.
Unpack the source tar ball, make a directory for building, and there run the script attached below.
If everything goes well, do something like this:
	make VERBOSE=1; make install DESTDIR=(path_to_install_dir).

#!/bin/sh -e
p=/sw
export KDE4_PREFIX=$p KDE4_TYPE=mac
. $p/sbin/kde4-buildenv.sh
export CXX="g++ -m32"
export CC="gcc -m32"
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug $KDE4_CMAKE_ARGS (path_to_source_dir)
