# `transaction_dynamic_node_test`: the fault is a `Packet` use-after-free

Handoff for the TLA+ work.  Written 2026-08-24 from the x86-64 / g++ 15.2 /
Ubuntu 26.04 `PREEMPT_RT` session (2 cores).  Continues
`origin/claude/great-turing-Ufao2` and the header of `soak_dynnode.sh`, which
narrowed the fault to ILP32 + the pool allocator and ended with "no backtrace
yet" on LP64.

**There is now an LP64 reproducer that fires most runs, and the fault has been
caught in the act.  It is not an allocator defect and not a miscompile.**

---

## 1. The finding

A `Packet` is destroyed while a live `PacketWrapper` still holds
`m_packet` pointing at it.  The `local_shared_ptr<Packet>` refcount reaches
zero with an outstanding reference.

Caught by poisoning every slot with `0xBAADF00DBAADF00D` inside
`deallocate_pooled_or_free()` (allocator-side, so it sees the library's own
internal allocations too) and running under gdb:

```
si_signo = 11 (SIGSEGV)
si_code  = 128  (SI_KERNEL — general-protection fault, non-canonical address)
si_addr  = 0x0  (#GP does not report the address here; si_code is the
                 discriminator, not si_addr)

fault at  Transactional::Node<LongNode>::bundle(...)+113
          transaction_impl.h:2733   Node &supernode(supscope->packet()->node());

  mov 0x18(%r14),%rax   ; rax = supscope's PacketWrapper*   0x7fffeb5847a0  valid
  mov 0x10(%rax),%rsi   ; rsi = wrapper->m_packet (Packet*) 0x7ffff53a0420  valid
  mov 0x8(%rsi),%rdx    ; rdx = packet->m_payload           0xbaadf00dbaadf00d  POISON
  mov 0x10(%rdx),%rdx   ; deref payload->m_node             → #GP
```

Offsets: `PacketWrapper` = {refcnt @0, `m_bundledBy` @8, `m_packet` @0x10};
`Packet` = {refcnt @0, `m_payload` @8}; `Payload` = {vptr @0, refcnt @8,
`m_node` @0x10}.

The **wrapper is not freed** — reading `m_packet` out of it yields a good
pointer.  The block that went through `free` is the **`Packet`**: its
`m_payload` word reads back as poison, which only happens if that whole slot
was deallocated.

Call stack at the fault (the cloud session's exact signature):

```
snapshot → bundle → bundle_subpacket → bundle → bundle_subpacket → bundle
```

## 2. What to model

The property to check is:

> **A `Packet`'s reference count reaches zero while a reachable
> `PacketWrapper` still references it.**

No allocator model is needed.  Earlier work (both sessions) chased an
allocator identity-reuse story; it is **refuted** — see §5.  The allocator
only decides what the freed `Packet`'s memory *contains* when the stale read
happens, which is why every compiler and allocator knob moved the failure
rate without being the cause.

Add a refcount to `Packet` in the existing `BundleUnbundle_*` family and
check that invariant.  The existing specs allocate fresh identities forever,
so they cannot currently express it.

### Topology the fault needs

Established by ablation (§4), so the model does not need to be larger than
this:

- **A static three-level shared tree** `gn1 ← gn2 ← gn3`.  Two levels did
  **not** reproduce (`TWOLEVEL` 0/8 against a 44 % base — provisional, worth
  one confirmation run before you rely on it, since it decides whether you
  model `BundleUnbundle_2level_*` or `_3level_*`).
- **N threads**, each holding a **thread-local** root `p1` with a child `p2`.
- **A hard link**: `p2` is spliced under `gn2` inside a `gn1`-rooted
  transaction while still a child of `p1`, so `p2` has two parents — one
  thread-local, one in the shared tree.  This is the
  `BundleUnbundle_hardlink_external*` shape ("external" = the other parent is
  outside the tree).
- Concurrently: a multi-node Tx rooted at `gn2` writing `gn2`/`gn3`, and two
  single-node Tx on the leaf `gn3`.
- **Repeated thread creation and exit** under a tree that outlives them.
  One round with the same total work does **not** fire; the per-round tree
  rebuild is **not** needed.

The crash sits in the recursive bundle build, so the interleaving to explore
is a `bundle` / `bundle_subpacket` recursion racing against whatever drops
the last reference to a `Packet` the recursion is walking.

### Where to look in the C++

- `bundle()` / `bundle_subpacket()` recursion, `transaction_impl.h` ~2733,
  ~2841 (`bundle_subpacket` call), ~2488 (`snapshot`'s call into `bundle`).
- `scoped_atomic_view` ownership transfers in
  `kamepoolalloc/atomic_smart_ptr.h`: the `local_shared_ptr<T>&&` move-in
  constructor and `assign_from_local()`, which hand a `+1` refcount around
  with **zero atomic operations** and document that the caller is responsible
  for the moved-from pointer being the atomic's current value ("we do NOT
  verify").
- `Linkage::~Linkage()` — `this->reset()` with the comment "Packet should be
  freed before memory pools".

## 3. The reproducer

`kamestm/tests/tmin_dynnode.cpp` (staged in this commit, 148 lines, from the
original 365).

```bash
c++ -DKAMEPOOLALLOC_DYLIB -DA_NO_P1TREE \
    -I kamestm/tests -I kamestm -I kamepoolalloc \
    -O3 -g -DNDEBUG -std=gnu++17 -include kamestm/tests/support_standalone.h \
    kamestm/tests/tmin_dynnode.cpp kamestm/tests/support_standalone.cpp \
    kamestm/threadlocal.cpp \
    -o tmin -Wl,-rpath,<build>/kamepoolalloc-tests \
    <build>/kamepoolalloc-tests/libkamepoolalloc.so -ldl

./tmin 100 16 1250      # rounds threads iters — ~25 s, fires 40-65 %
```

`-DA_NO_P1TREE` is the recommended base (see §4).  Failure modes: SIGSEGV,
SIGABRT (uncaught `NodeNotFoundError`), hang, and `failed objcnt=N` — the
last being the ILP32 signature from `d76e5b2d9`, which does occur on LP64.

The original test needed `NUM_THREADS 4 → 8` to fire at all on LP64
(~50 %/60 s); this is 25 s and needs no source change.

### To turn the failure on and off

`-O3` vs `-O3 -fno-ipa-cp-clone` on `allocator.cpp` is a reliable switch:
**43/100 vs 0/167**.  Use it as an experimental control.  It is *not* a lead
— see §5.

To make a stale read fault immediately and identifiably, apply the poison
patch to `deallocate_pooled_or_free()` (scratch copy of `allocator.cpp`):

```c
if(p) {
    std::size_t _psz = kame_pool_malloc_usable_size(p);
    if(_psz >= 16 && _psz <= 4096) {
        std::uint64_t *_q = reinterpret_cast<std::uint64_t *>(p);
        for(std::size_t _i = 0; _i < _psz / 8; ++_i)
            _q[_i] = 0xBAADF00DBAADF00DULL;
    }
}
```

It must go **inside the library**.  An `operator new`/`malloc` interposer in
the executable does not work: the `.so` is built with
`-fno-semantic-interposition`, so its internal allocations bind to its own
definitions and never cross the boundary.  Four rounds of filtering left a
false-positive floor of ~450 per run, identical in failing and clean builds.

## 4. Ablation — what the fault needs

Each arm removes one element.  All runs `100 16 1250`.

**On the tree-rebuilt base (16 runs/arm):**

| removed | failed |
|---|---|
| nothing | 7 / 16 |
| main thread's `gn3->insert/release(gn4)` churn | 6 / 16 |
| `gn2->swap(p2, gn3)` | 6 / 16 |
| `gn4` transaction | 0 / 16 |
| `p1->insert/release(p2)` | 0 / 16 |
| `trans(*gn3)` pair | 0 / 16 |

**On the keep-tree base (15 runs/arm):**

| removed | failed |
|---|---|
| nothing | 7 / 15 |
| the `gn1` multi-node Tx | 10 / 15 |
| the `p1`-into-`gn1` splice | 8 / 15 |
| the `p2`-into-`gn2` splice | 6 / 15 |
| the `gn2` Tx | 0 / 15 |
| the private `p1`/`p2` churn | 0 / 14 |
| the `trans(*gn3)` pair | 0 / 15 |

**On the `A_NO_P1TREE` base (9 runs/arm):** base 4/9; every further cut 0/9;
`TWOLEVEL` 0/8.

**Cuts do not compose.**  Three arms that were individually free (10/15,
8/15, 6/15) gave 0/6 when applied together, and `gn1TX + p1TREE` gave 0/4.
Each cut also removes concurrency, so re-ablate after every adopted cut and
compensate with thread count — raising 8 → 16 threads restored 4/4 after
`gn4` was removed.

Removed and verified unnecessary: `ComplexNode`, the whole single-threaded
setup block, every `print_()`/`tr1.print()` dump, the main-thread churn,
`gn2->swap`, `gn4`, the per-round tree rebuild, and the `total` payload-sum
bookkeeping.

## 5. Retracted claims

Recorded so nobody re-derives them.  Several are mine from this session.

- **"Chunk identity reuse is the vehicle."**  The theory was that an
  `LRC_CHUNK` block sits in the recycle cache with its units still claimed
  and `chunk_header` intact, so a stale pointer still resolves through the
  radix.  Disabling the chunk cache entirely (`large_recycle_push` refuses
  `LRC_CHUNK`) gives **13/30 against a control of 12/31**.  Refuted.
- **"Aggregate codegen perturbation hides it."**  Refuted by perturbing
  without removing the clones: `-fno-ipa-sra` 10/16, `-fno-inline-functions`
  8/16, `--param inline-unit-growth=10` 7/16 (334 functions reshuffled),
  against `NC7` 0/16 (144 reshuffled).  The earlier monotone-in-perturbation
  trend was an artefact of 7–9 run samples.
- **"`-fipa-cp-clone` is a miscompile."**  It is an accelerator.  It changes
  what the freed `Packet`'s memory contains when the stale read happens.
  Same `mmap`/`munmap` counts and same wall time either way.
- **"The clone bodies accept an undersized block."**  `sz >= need` is present
  in the clone as `$262143`; checked on the ILP32 side.
- **"`noclone` on one function isolates that clone."**  It does not —
  suppressing one clone changes 72 other functions' sizes.
- **"`noclone`×5 ≡ `-fno-ipa-cp-clone`."**  True on i586/g++13, **false** on
  x86-64/g++15, where `bucket_release_chunk` (3 clones) and
  `find_training_zeros` (2) survive.  Seven functions are needed here, and
  clone-set equality is still not codegen equality (34 function sizes differ).
- **"The release fence is on the wrong side by construction."**  Wrong;
  `writeBarrier()` is `atomic_thread_fence(release)`, undeletable, and its
  partner is the client's later atomic publication.
- **`LOCAL_REF_CAPACITY`** — already withdrawn by the other session on
  arm64's 2400 clean runs; `KAME_LOCAL_REF_CAPACITY_OVERRIDE=4` on x86-64
  added nothing here either.

## 6. Experimental record

So these are not re-run.  All on the minimised reproducer unless noted.

| experiment | result |
|---|---|
| pool ON vs OFF (8-thread original) | fires 40–75 % vs **0/6**, 0/8 |
| `operator new` quarantine, reuse delayed 2 M allocations | **0/41** vs 13/41 |
| gcc-STM + clang-pool | **0/12** |
| clang-STM + gcc-pool | 8/12 |
| gcc vs clang, full test | 10/19 vs **0/19** |
| allocator `-O3` / `-O2` / `-Os` / `-O1` | 6/8, **0/8**, **0/8**, **0/7** |
| `-O2` + all 13 `-O3` flags / first 7 / last 6 | 13/28, 13/28, **0/27** |
| per-flag: only `-fipa-cp-clone` non-zero | 2/10, others 0/10 |
| `-O3 -fno-ipa-cp-clone` | **0/67**, and `NC7` **0/100** |
| `-O2 -fipa-cp-clone` | 19/35 |
| `seq_cst` on every atomic in the allocator | **55/100** — no effect |
| full fence at 4 acquire/release seams (each) | 48–54/100 — no effect |
| chunk recycle cache disabled | 13/30 — no effect |
| cross-thread batch `cap = 1` | **0/16**, 0/12 |
| batching kept, per-slot flush (no sort/merge/CAS-merge) | 5/16 — protocol innocent |
| pool exclusivity stress, 256 M ops, 3200 thread spawns | **0 violations** |

Note the non-monotonicity: reuse delayed ~0 (`cap = 1`) is clean, ~1024 frees
(default batching) fails, 2 M allocations (quarantine) is clean.  Both
extremes clean, middle fails.  That is consistent with the UAF reading — what
changes is only whether the freed `Packet`'s memory still looks valid at the
moment of the stale read — but it is not a monotone "reuse distance" effect
and should not be described as one.

## 7. Loose ends

- `TWOLEVEL` 0/8 is provisional and decides 2-level vs 3-level for the model.
- The STM throws `NodeNotFoundError` (a `std::domain_error`) out of the
  `Transaction` constructor uncaught, so an inconsistency it detects itself
  takes the process down.  Noted by the other session in `251edf60c`; still
  worth fixing independently of this bug.
- Whether the ILP32 fault is the same defect is now testable directly: apply
  the poison patch there and check `si_code` and the faulting register.

## 8. Refcount event tracing (`KAME_RC_TRACE`) — added 2026-08-24

The next step chosen over more modelling: instrument the `Packet` refcount
itself and let the reproducer name the guilty increment/decrement.  Hooks in
`kamepoolalloc/atomic_smart_ptr.h` (no-ops unless `-DKAME_RC_TRACE`), runtime
in `kamestm/tests/rc_trace.cpp`.

**Coverage.** Every strong-count change that goes through `local_shared_ptr`
(copy ctors, `reset()`), plus control-block birth via the `atomic_countable`
ctor.  `Packet`/`Payload` are intrusive `atomic_countable` and are never
installed in an `atomic_shared_ptr`, so their histories are **complete**.
`PacketWrapper` histories are **partial** (the atomic-side machinery — tag
drains, CAS transfers — is untraced).  Biased branches (`KAME_LSP_BIASED`)
are untraced; keep it off.

**Tripwires** (abort at the guilty call site, with history dump):

- `INC-FROM-ZERO`: copying a `local_shared_ptr` whose count is `0` **or
  ≥ 2^48** — the threshold matters because with the §3 poison patch a freed
  slot's count reads `0xBAADF00DBAADF00D`, not `0`.  This fires at the exact
  *stale copy* site, earlier than the poison `#GP`.
- `DEC-UNDERFLOW`: `reset()` on a count of `0` / poisoned — the exact *stale
  release* site.

Per-thread rings (64 rings × 16384 events, recycled round-robin — safe under
the reproducer's thread churn since events carry the real tid), TSC
sequencing on x86-64 (no shared cacheline on the record path).

**Build** (the §3 line plus two additions):

```bash
c++ -DKAMEPOOLALLOC_DYLIB -DA_NO_P1TREE -DKAME_RC_TRACE \
    -I kamestm/tests -I kamestm -I kamepoolalloc \
    -O3 -g -DNDEBUG -std=gnu++17 -include kamestm/tests/support_standalone.h \
    kamestm/tests/tmin_dynnode.cpp kamestm/tests/rc_trace.cpp \
    kamestm/tests/support_standalone.cpp kamestm/threadlocal.cpp \
    -o tmin_rct -Wl,-rpath,<build>/kamepoolalloc-tests \
    <build>/kamepoolalloc-tests/libkamepoolalloc.so -ldl
```

Keep the poisoned allocator `.so` from §3 — poison is what makes the stale
access *identifiable*; the thresholds make it *attributable*.

**Run**: `gdb --args ./tmin_rct 100 16 1250`, then either

1. a tripwire aborts first (the good case): the `abort()` backtrace **is** the
   guilty site; the stderr dump shows the object's whole inc/dec history with
   per-event `tid` and resolved sites; or
2. the poison `#GP` fires as in §1: then
   `call kame_rc_dump((const void*)$rsi)` — read the history for the freed
   `Packet`: look for the `DEC`/`DEAD` that has no matching owner, or the
   `DEAD → BORN` (slot recycled as a new Packet) followed by a `DEC` from a
   thread that should no longer hold it.  `call kame_rc_dump_recent(200)`
   prints cross-thread context around the fault.

**Perturbation caveat**: the hooks add a TLS ring store + (x86) a `rdtsc`
per refcount op.  §4's rule applies — if the fire rate collapses, raise the
thread count (16 → 24) rather than concluding anything.

What this decides: whether the premature zero is a *double release* (extra
`DEC` — its site named directly), a *missing increment* (history shows N
owners but N−1 `INC`s — the transfer that skipped its `INC` is the edge
between the last two events), or a *stale release onto a recycled slot*
(`DEAD → BORN → DEC` signature).  Each of the three points at a different
`bundle`/`bundle_subpacket` edge; §2's model can then be built around the
named edge instead of the whole recursion.
